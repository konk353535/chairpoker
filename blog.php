        <h1>Classical Music</h1>
       <p>It’s not just kids that can benefit from musical training or exposure. 
        Stroke patients in one small study showed improved visual attention while listening to classical music.
        </p>
        <p>
            The study also tried white noise and silence to compare the results, and found that, like the driving study mentioned earlier, silence resulted in the worst scores.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because this study was so small, the conclusions need to be explored further for validation, but I find it really interesting how music and noise can affect our other senses and abilities—in this case, vision.
        </p>
        <p>So get along to some classical music events today, visit our <a href='events.php'> events </a> page to find upcoming musical events.
